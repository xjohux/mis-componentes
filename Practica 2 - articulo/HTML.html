        <h1>This is the main headline of the article</h1>

        <h2>This is a second level heading</h2>

        <p>Here comes the first paragraph of text that describes what this article will be about. <strong>Its second sentence is so important it gets marked additionally.</strong></p>

        <figure>"Then comes a longer quotation from long ago that makes you think."</figure>

        <p>In the second paragraph there is nothing interesting. But after the second paragraph there is an image of a tree.</p>
